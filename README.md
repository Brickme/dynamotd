dynamotd: dynamic MOTD ***boom!***

Basically 99% of it is/was from the package in Ubuntu.
And the Debian installation adaptation comes from https://nickcharlton.net/posts/debian-ubuntu-dynamic-motd.html

Motivation for this:
I wanted to have it easily and readily available. And also wanted to make a couple of tweaks (show available RAM and disk).
